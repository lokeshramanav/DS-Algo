#How to prepare for Data strucutes and algorithms 

1. Understand the Data Structures and algorithm by creating flow charts / Diagrams
2. Code it in Javascript + test cases for that data structure / algorithm
3. Code it in Python + test cases for that data structure / algorithm
4. Code it in Java + test cases for that data structure / algorithm
5. Code it in Golang + test cases for that data structure / algorithm
6. Big O notation for the Data structure and algorithm (space and time complexity)
7. Pros and cons for the data structure and algorithm
8. Real world use case of the data structure and algorithm
