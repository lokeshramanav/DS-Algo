ES6 has built in set object 

has --> check for the presence of the element in the set 
values --> return all the values of the set 
add --> add element in the set 
remove --> removes the element from the set 
size --> length of the set 
union --> union of two different sets , combine the sets and leave out the duplicates
intersection --> intersection of two different sets , only the same elements in both the sets 
difference --> all the elements are in one set and not in another set 
subset --> test is a subset of the different set , contains all the values of second set in first set 

indexOf if element is not present it will return -1

The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.

const isBelowThreshold = (currentValue) => currentValue < 40;

const array1 = [1, 30, 39, 29, 10, 13];

console.log(array1.every(isBelowThreshold));
// expected output: true
